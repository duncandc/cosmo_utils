# Cosmology Utilities

This is a collection of Python functions to aid in cosmological calculations.  

## Requirements

## Disclaimer

This code is primarily written for my own personal research use.  That being said, anyone is free to copy and use these functions; however, I can not guarantee there are no bugs or errors.  Formal testing of these functions is very limited.  If you find errors or have any questions, I would be happy to try to address them.
